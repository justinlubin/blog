This is my first post! How exciting!

### Testing out Markdown

This is pretty cool! I wonder if I can write code?

```Haskell
f : Int -> Int
f x = x * x

f . f
```

Anyway, here's a quote:

> Wow I really like this?
> I actually do!
> This is nice.

Anyway, that's all for now! (Is that a smart quote?)
